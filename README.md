# Jexxa - A Ports and Adapters Framework for Java
Jexxa is a lightweight framework to implement durable business applications based on a [ports and adapters](https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/) architecture (aka _hexagonal architecture_). Following the UNIX philosophy `do one thing and do it well`, Jexxa is no general purpose framework such as Spring or Jakarta EE. 

Goal of this framework is to support the development of _durable_ business applications in conjunction with Domain Driven Design as good as possible. Therefore, Jexxa stresses the following aspects in particular:

*   **Technology-agnostic**: The framework is designed to avoid technology-specific dependencies in business applications. See [here](https://jexxa-projects.github.io/Jexxa/jexxa_architecture.html#_ioc_without_annotations) for more information.
*   **Visible flow of control**: Simplified navigation through your business application. Checkout [this tutorial](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTutorials/blob/main/TimeService/README-FlowOfControl.md) for more information.
*   **Aligned team development**: The framework is tailored to the _needs and development of teams_ developing business applications. See [Jexxa's General Design Decisions](https://jexxa-projects.github.io/Jexxa/jexxa_architecture.html#_general_design_decisions) for more information. 

In addition, Jexxa offers following production-proven features:    

*   Integrated most common driving adapters: RMI over REST, and JMS. 
*   Integrated strategies for most common driven adapters: JDBC, in memory DB (IMDB), and JMS. 
*   Integrated stubs to write unit-tests without mock frameworks.

## Built With

Apart from some other great open source libraries, Jexxa mainly utilises the following libraries and frameworks:

*   [ClassGraph](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph)
*   [javalin](http://javalin.io/)

## Quickstart

### Start programming 

Below, you see a simple ``Hello World`` example that is described in detail [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTutorials/tree/main/HelloJexxa):  

```java     
public final class HelloJexxa
{
    // Our business logic ;-)
    public String greetings()                 { return "Hello Jexxa"; }

    public static void main(String[] args)    {
        //Create your jexxaMain for this application
        var jexxaMain = new JexxaMain(HelloJexxa.class);

        jexxaMain
                // Bind a REST adapter to expose parts of the application
                // Get greetings: http://localhost:7501/HelloJexxa/greetings
                .bind(RESTfulRPCAdapter.class).to(HelloJexxa.class)  
                  
                // Run Jexxa and all bindings until Ctrl-C is pressed
                .run();
    }
}
```    

### Add Dependencies
Whenever possible, Jexxa is developed against standard APIs. This allows a business application to use the preferred
technology stacks. Therefore, our `HelloJexxa` application needs two dependencies: `jexxa-web` and a logger that fulfills
your requirements, such as `slf4j-simple`. 

Maven:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
       <groupId>io.jexxa</groupId>
       <artifactId>jexxa-web</artifactId>
       <version>5.7.1</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.6</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
compile "io.jexxa:jexxa-web:5.7.1"
compile "org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.6"
``` 

### Configure your Jexxa application  

By default, a Jexxa application looks for the following properties file. For more information please refer to the 
[reference guide](https://jexxa-projects.github.io/Jexxa/jexxa_reference.html#_application_configuration). 

```maven
resources/jexxa-application.properties
```                                   

Available properties are described [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/blob/master/jexxa-web/src/test/resources/jexxa-application.properties).
