## \[7.0.0] - 2023-12-16
## Changed
- Jexxa now utilises [Jexxa-Adapters](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaAdapters) as underlying technology stack. This enables to focus Jexxa more on its API and simplifies reusing technology stacks in other projects.
- For jexxa based applications, you typically only need to adjust the imports as described in the migration notes below.  

### Migration notes from 6.x.x -> 7.x.x!
To simplify migration, you have to adjust the following imports: 
- Static imports
    - `io.jexxa.infrastructure.MessageSenderManager` -> `io.jexxa.common.drivenadapter.messaging.MessageSenderManager`
    - `io.jexxa.infrastructure.ObjectStoreManager` -> `io.jexxa.common.drivenadapter.persistence.ObjectStoreManager`
    - `io.jexxa.infrastructure.RepositoryManager` -> `io.jexxa.common.drivenadapter.persistence.RepositoryManager`

### Changedâ€”Important Information!

- With this major release, Jexxa focuses more on typical microservices patterns. To better highlight them, the following changes have been made to the package structures:
  - `core`: Provides the main entry point for a Jexxa application
  - `drivingadapter`: Provides ready-to-use driving adapter to receive and forward incoming requests to the application core 
  - `infrastructure`: Replaces old `drivenadapterstrategy` and provides implementation of typical application infrastructure patterns that simplify the implementation of driven adapters
  - `common`: Provides wrapper to standard java libraries used by Jexxa. The main focus is to simplify and reduce these APIs to the requirements of Jexxa. This package is a candidate to be externalized in future major releases.     
 
- `TransactionalOutboxSender` is now used by default for sending messages.   

- Renamed `JexxaLogger` &rarr; `SLF4JLogger` to clarify its responsibility.
- Renamed `Monitors` &rarr; `HealthIndicators` to clarify its responsibility. 
- Renamed `TimerMonitor` &rarr; `TimeoutIndicator` to clarify its responsibility.

- Changed HTTP-properties to meet declaration convention: 
  - `io.jexxa.rest.open_api_path` &rarr; `io.jexxa.rest.openapi.path`
  - `io.jexxa.rest.static_files_root` &rarr; `io.jexxa.rest.static.files.root`
  - `io.jexxa.rest.static_files_external` &rarr; `io.jexxa.rest.static.files.external` 

- Changed HTTPS-properties to meet declaration convention:
  - `io.jexxa.rest.https_port` &rarr; `io.jexxa.rest.https.port`
  - `io.jexxa.rest.keystore_password` &rarr; `io.jexxa.rest.keystore.password`
  - `io.jexxa.rest.file.keystore_password` &rarr; `io.jexxa.rest.keystore.file.password`
  - `io.jexxa.rest.keystore` &rarr; `io.jexxa.rest.keystore.location`

- Removed all deprecated declarations:
  - Jexxa-Adapter-API: Removed `InvocationHandler` which is named now `JexxaInvocationHandler` 
  - Jexxa-Core: Removed deprecated `JMXAdapter` and deprecated static properties
  - Jexxa-Web: Removed deprecated static properties 

### Added
- `IdempotentListener`: Discards duplicate messages based on a unique key in message header
- `ObjectStore`: creates a combined index for all values that can be searched for.   

### Fixed
- Updated dependencies

## \[5.7.1] - 2023-02-24
### Fixed
- Updated dependencies
- `TransactionalOutboxSender` initiates sending of messages directly after storing messages so that no additional delay occurs 

## \[5.7.0] - 2023-02-19
### Added
- [ #186 ](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/issues/186) Jexxa-Core: Added support for a transactional outbox pattern for sending JMS messages, called `TransactionalOutboxSender`. By default, the old `JMSSender` is still used. 

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

## \[5.6.0] - 2023-01-08

### Added
- Jexxa-Core: Improved API for bootstrapping classes in main() that need no initialization method. See [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTemplate) for more information. 
  
- Jexxa-Core: JMSConfiguration can be provided by a method of the message listener. This allows implementing configurable message listener. See [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/blob/master/jexxa-core/src/test/java/io/jexxa/infrastructure/utils/messaging/ConfigurableListener.java) for an example.  

- Jexxa-Test: Provided convenience classes for implementing integration tests. For detailed information and example, look [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTemplate).

### Changed
- Jexxa-Core: static definitions of JMS properties are now provided via `JexxaJMSProperties` for unification reason. The old properties provided in `JMSAdapter` are declared deprecated.

### Changed
- [Issue #142](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/issues/140) Jexxa-Web: Updated from javalin4 to javalin5. This required reimplementing OpenAPI functionality because javalin5 no longer supports a Java-DSL to provide OpenAPI information. Even though the public API of Jexxa-Web is not changed we decided to increment minor version due to the re-implementation of OpenAPI 

### Fixed
- Updated dependencies


## \[5.4.0] - 2022-11-05
### Added
- Jexxa-Core: Added new driving adapter `Scheduler` which allows to call methods on a fixed rate or fixed delay as described in [issue #140](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/issues/140). See [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/blob/master/jexxa-web/src/test/resources/jexxa-application.properties) for more some examples hwo to use it. 

### Fixed
- Updated dependencies


## \[5.3.1] - 2022-10-27
### Fixed
- Explicitly define one latest gson version as dependency for jexxa-web. This ensures that maven will use this version within your application because it is the shortest path as a transitive dependency. In case your application uses an older gson version (also as transitive dependency), you could get an IllegalAccessException because deserialization of a Java record fails.  

- Updated dependencies

## \[5.3.0] - 2022-10-26
### Added
- Jexxa-Test: Possibility to define one stubs for your tests

  was passed. This fix ensures that all parameters of a shared connection are correctly handled 

## \[5.2.0] - 2022-09-11
### Added
- Jexxa-Core: Possibility to define JMS >=2.0 parameter for listener  

## \[5.1.2] - 2022-09-10

## \[5.1.0] - 2022-08-15
### Added
- Jexxa-Test: 
  - Added static method `getJexxaTest, which also instantiates JexxaMain. This ensures that all driven adapters are correctly configured before any method on JexxaMain is called  
  - Added rules to validate the architecture of your application. 
  - See [JexxaTemplate](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTemplate) for more information

### Fixed
- Jexxa-Core: If deserialization of record fails, the exception from the canonical constructor is forwarded (if available). 

## \[5.0.2] - 2022-08-05
### Fixed
- Updated dependencies

## \[5.0.1] - 2022-07-09
### Fixed

## \[5.0.0] - 2022-06-17
### Changedâ€”Important Information!
- With this major release, Jexxa supports only Java versions >=17.
- See [JexxaTemplate](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTemplate) or [JexxaTutorials](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTutorials) for examples.

- Jexxa-Core:
  - Removed all deprecated methods: 
    - Constructor `JexxaMain(String contextName, Properties applicationProperties)` was removed. Instead use  `JexxaMain(Class<?> context, Properties applicationProperties)`
  - Changed getter-API for exposed classes such as `BoundedContext` so that they do not use prefix `get` as introduced with naming conventions of Java records.

- JexxaMain: 
  - Streamlined main: Method `addDDDPackages` is invoked by default for the given context. 

- Messaging Strategy:
  - According to a Repository, you can now define the used messaging strategy for each interface. Therefore, you have to pass the implemented interface to the MessageSenderManager when querying the strategy.

- Properties: 
  - Driven-Adapter-Strategies can now be defined in the properties files. 
  - In general, Jexxa applications have up to three different configurations (at max): 
    - jexxa-application.properties: Is automatically loaded and should include your production settings
    - jexxa-test.properties: Overwrites all production settings for local testing
    - jexxa-local.properties: Overwrites all production settings so that the application can run without an infrastructure. This is only recommended for demo purpose or rapid prototyping. 
    - Please refer to [reference guide](https://jexxa-projects.github.io/Jexxa/jexxa_reference.html#_application_configuration) for more information.

### Added
- Jexxa-Core: 
    - Jexxa includes full support for Java `record` (de-)serialization by default. So no explicit serializer needs to be defined within the infrastructure of your application.
    
- JexxaMain:
  - Added convenience method `run()` that invokes `start()`, `waitUntilShutdown()`, and `stop()`
  - Added method `logUnhealthyDiagnostics` to log unhealthy diagnostics for registered Monitors

-   JDBCQuery: Corrected usage of PreparedStatement to correctly close the resource.  

## \[3.0.5] - 2021-07-10
### Fixed
-   JDBCCommand / JDBCQuery: Internal used PreparedStatement is now correctly closed to avoid issues with dangling resources. 
    Note: Even though this issue depends on your database driver, it occurs at least on Oracle databases.
    
### Changed 
-   Updated dependencies on minor and patch level

## \[3.0.4] - 2021-06-18
### Fixed
-   JexxaMain: If a specific driving adapter is bound to a port adapter, Jexxa ensures that the specific driving adapter is instantiated only once.

### Fixed
-   `JSONManager`: 
    -   Bugfix for Java 16+: Added default serializer/deserializer for Java8-time classes, because they are strongly encapsulated since Java 16. The added serializer/deserializer avoid an `IllegalAccessException` when they are serialized to/from Json.
-   Fixed issues from static code analysis tool codacy 
-   Updated dependencies on patch level 

## \[3.0.0] - 2021-04-03
### Changed
-   Introduced new package Jexxa-Web, which includes all web-specific plugins, such as `RESTfulRPCAdapter`. See [reference guide](https://jexxa-projects.github.io/Jexxa/jexxa_reference.html#_jexxa_modules) for more information. If your application uses this adapter, you have now to add dependency `jexxa-web`. See tutorial [HelloJexxa](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTutorials/tree/main/HelloJexxa/README.md) for an example.  
-   Removed all methods and constants declared deprecated in 2.x

### Fixed
-   `RESTfulRPCAdapter`: 
    -   OpenAPI plugin uses global JSONManager for creating prototypes so that specific type IConverter can be registered    
    
## \[2.8.1] - 2021-02-27
### Fixed
-   Updated JaCoCo plugin so that tests run under Java 15
-   Corrected suffixes of integration tests so that maven option `-DskipITs` works correct

-   Corrected handling of Java8 Date API so that a date is handled as a string conform to ISO 8601. See [here](https://jexxa-projects.github.io/Jexxa/jexxa_reference.html#_json_representation_of_date) for more information. Affected adapter are: 
    -   `JDBCKeyValueRepository`   
    -   `JMSSender`
    -   `JSONMessageListener`:
    
## \[2.7.3] - 2021-01-22

## \[2.5.0] - 2020-10-21
### Added
-   `RESTfulRPCAdapter`: Added OpenAPI support (see [jexxa-application.properties](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/blob/master/jexxa-web/src/test/resources/jexxa-application.properties) for more information).  
-   `JexxaMain`: Improved fluent API in `JexxaMain` with `conditionalBind()` which performs a binding only if a condition statement evaluates to true. See tutorial [`TimeService`](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTutorials/tree/main/TimeService) for example.
-   Added a [reference guide](https://jexxa-projects.github.io/Jexxa/jexxa_reference.html).
