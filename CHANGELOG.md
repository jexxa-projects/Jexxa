## \[5.7.0] - 2023-02-xx
### Added
- [ #186 ] Jexxa-Core: Added support for transactional outbox pattern for sending JMS messages. By default, the old JMSSender is still used. See [here](jexxa-core/src/test/java/io/jexxa/infrastructure/drivenadapterstrategy/messaging/jms/JMSSenderIT.java) how to enable the new message sender.    

### Changed
- Jexxa-Core: Declared JMXDrivingAdapter as deprecated since it is no longer used in any project.

### Fixed
- Updated dependencies

## \[5.6.2] - 2023-02-02

### Fixed
- Updated dependencies

## \[5.6.1] - 2023-01-26

### Fixed

- Updated dependencies

## \[5.6.0] - 2023-01-08

### Added
- Jexxa-Core: Improved API for bootstrapping classes in main() that need no initialization method. See [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTemplate) for more information. 
  
- Jexxa-Core: JMSConfiguration can be provided by a method of the message listener. This allows to implement configurable message listener. See [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/blob/master/jexxa-core/src/test/java/io/jexxa/infrastructure/utils/messaging/ConfigurableListener.java) for an example.  

- Jexxa-Test: Provided convenience classes for implementing integration tests. For detailed information and example look [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTemplate).

### Changed
- Jexxa-Core: static definitions of JMS properties are now provided via `JexxaJMSProperties` for unification reason. The old properties provided in `JMSAdapter` are declared deprecated.

### Fixed
- Updated dependencies

## \[5.5.4] - 2022-12-19
### Fixed
- Updated dependencies

## \[5.5.3] - 2022-12-11
### Fixed
- Updated dependencies

## \[5.5.2] - 2022-12-03
### Fixed
- Removed unnecessary transitive dependency snakeyaml due to security issue [CVE-2022-41854](https://devhub.checkmarx.com/cve-details/CVE-2022-41854/)
- Updated dependencies

## \[5.5.1] - 2022-11-23
### Fixed
- Generation of OpenAPI documentation for arrays of base types, such as String[] 
- Updated dependencies
 
## \[5.5.0] - 2022-11-20
### Added
- Jexxa-Core: Provide possibility to configure `user.timezone` via jexxa-application.properties value `io.jexxa.user.timezone`. See [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/blob/master/jexxa-web/src/test/resources/jexxa-application.properties) for more information

### Changed
- [Issue #142](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/issues/140) Jexxa-Web : Updated from javalin4 to javalin5. This required to reimplement OpenAPI functionality because javalin5 no longer supports a Java-DSL to provide OpenAPI information. Even though the public API of Jexxa-Web is not changed we decided to increment minor version due to the re-implementation of OpenAPI 

### Fixed
- Updated dependencies


## \[5.4.0] - 2022-11-05
### Added
- Jexxa-Core: Added new driving adapter `Scheduler` which allows to call methods on a fixed rate or fixed delay as described in [issue #140](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/issues/140). See [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/blob/master/jexxa-web/src/test/resources/jexxa-application.properties) for more some examples hwo to use it. 

### Fixed
- Updated dependencies


## \[5.3.1] - 2022-10-27
### Fixed
- Explicitly define latest gson version as dependency for jexxa-web. This ensures that maven will use this version within your application because it is the shortest path as transitive dependency. In case your application uses an older gson version (also as transitive dependency), you could get an IllegalAccessException because deserialization of a Java record fails.  

- Updated dependencies

## \[5.3.0] - 2022-10-26
### Added
- Jexxa-Test: Possibility to define one stubs for your tests

### Changed
- Jexxa now uses (de)serialization methods for Java records provided in latest GSon library

### Added
- Updated dependencies with security issues

## \[5.2.2] - 2022-10-03
### Fixed
- Improved log messages in case of an error during startup
- Updated dependencies 

## \[5.2.1] - 2022-09-11
* [Fix] JMSAdapter: Specified name for a shared connection was not passed to JMS broker, instead the message selector 
  was passed. This fix ensures that all parameters of a shared connection are correctly handled 

## \[5.2.0] - 2022-09-11
### Added
- Jexxa-Core: Possibility to define JMS >=2.0 parameter for listener  

## \[5.1.2] - 2022-09-10

## \[5.1.1] - 2022-09-07
### Fixed
- Updated dependencies

## \[5.1.0] - 2022-08-15
### Added
- Jexxa-Test: 
  - Added static method getJexxaTest which also instantiates JexxaMain. This ensures that all driven adapter are correctly configured before any method on JexxaMain is called  
  - Added rules to validate architecture of your application. 
  - See [JexxaTemplate](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTemplate) for more information

### Fixed
- Jexxa-Core: If deserialization of record fails, the exception from the canonical constructor is forwarded (if available). 

## \[5.0.2] - 2022-08-05
### Fixed
- Updated dependencies

## \[5.0.1] - 2022-07-09
### Fixed
- MessageLogger shows also message properties
- Updated dependencies


## \[5.0.0] - 2022-06-17
### Changed - Important Information!
- With this major release Jexxa supports only Java versions >=17.
- See [JexxaTemplate](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTemplate) or [JexxaTutorials](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTutorials) for examples.

- Jexxa-Core:
  - Removed all deprecated methods: 
    - Constructor `JexxaMain(String contextName, Properties applicationProperties)` was removed. Instead use  `JexxaMain(Class<?> context, Properties applicationProperties)`
  - Changed getter-API for exposed classes such as `BoundedContext` so that they do not use prefix `get` as introduced with naming conventions of Java records.

- JexxaMain: 
  - Streamlined main: Method `addDDDPackages` is invoked by default for the given context. 

- Messaging Strategy:
  - According to a Repository, you can now define the used messaging strategy for each interface. Therefore, you have to pass the implemented interface to the MessageSenderManager when querying the strategy.

- Properties: 
  - Driven-Adapter-Strategies can now be defined in the properties files. 
  - In general, Jexxa applications have up to three different configurations (at max): 
    - jexxa-application.properties: Is automatically load and should include your production settings
    - jexxa-test.properties: Overwrites all production settings for local testing
    - jexxa-local.properties: Overwrites all production settings so that the application can run without an infrastructure. This is only recommended for demo purpose or rapid prototyping. 
    - Please refer to [reference guide](https://jexxa-projects.github.io/Jexxa/jexxa_reference.html#_application_configuration) for more information.

### Added
- Jexxa-Core: 
    - Jexxa includes full support for Java `record` (de-)serialization by default. So no explicit serializer needs to be defined within the infrastructure of your application.
    
- JexxaMain:
  - Added convenience method `run()` that invokes `start()`, `waitUntilShutdown()`, and `stop()`
  - Added method `logUnhealthyDiagnostics` to log unhealthy diagnostics for registered Monitors

-   Added ObjectStore which provides sophisticated API for querying managed objects. See tutorial [Contract Management](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/Jexxa/blob/master/tutorials/ContractManagement/README.md)  

### Changed
-   Default port for tutorials from 7000 -> 7500 because macOS Monterey uses port 7000 for its control center
-   Updated dependencies 

## \[3.0.6] - 2021-07-13
### Fixed
-   JDBCQuery: Corrected usage of PreparedStatement to correctly close the resource.  

## \[3.0.5] - 2021-07-10
### Fixed

### Changed 
-   Updated dependencies on minor and patch level

## \[3.0.4] - 2021-06-18
### Fixed
-   JexxaMain: If a specific driving adapter is bound to a port adapter Jexxa ensured that the specific driving adapter is instantiated only once. Without this fix it could happen that a specific driving adapter is instantiated multiple times. In case the specific driving adapter uses resources such as a port this led to an exception.

See [reference guide](https://jexxa-projects.github.io/Jexxa/jexxa_reference.html#_jexxa_modules) for more information. If your application uses this adapter, you have now to add dependency `jexxa-web`. See tutorial [HelloJexxa](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTutorials/tree/main/HelloJexxa/README.md) for an example.  
-   Removed all methods and constants that were declared deprecated in 2.x

### Fixed
-   `RESTfulRPCAdapter`: 
    -   OpenAPI plugin uses global JSONManager for creating prototypes so that specific type IConverter can be registered
